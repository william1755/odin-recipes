    <h3>This is a recipe I have grown up with all of my life, from my southern grandma, she would always make these during the holidays. These are commonly consumed as an appetizer before thanksgiving or christmas dinner, just be sure not to eat too many! These are a savory snack with salty and optionally spicy sausage paired with cheddar cheese, and a crunch from the baked bisquik in them.</h3>

    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
